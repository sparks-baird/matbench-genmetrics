    "This Python script employs a five-folds leveraging the `mp_time_split` subpackage. By treating materials discovered in the future as generated data, the script benchmarks the progress of materials discovery over time. Each fold partitions the dataset into distinct training, validation, and generated sets, simulating the incremental advancement of materials science."
