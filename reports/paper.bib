  abstract = {The idea of materials discovery has excited and perplexed research scientists for centuries. Several different methods have been employed to find new types of materials, ranging from the arbitrary replacement of atoms in a crystal structure to advanced machine learning methods for predicting entirely new crystal structures. In this work, we pursue three primary objectives. I) Introduce CrysTens, a crystal encoding that can be used in a wide variety of deep-learning generative models. II) Investigate and analyze the performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models to find an innovative and effective way of generating theoretical crystal structures that are synthesizable and stable. III) Show that the models that have a better ``understanding'' of the structure of CrysTens produce more symmetrical and realistic crystals and exhibit a better apprehension of the dataset as a whole. We accomplish these objectives using over fifty thousand Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) from Pearson's Crystal Database.},

  abstract = {Assessing the synthesizability of inorganic materials is a grand challenge for accelerating their discovery using computations. Synthesis of a material is a complex process that depends not only on its thermodynamic stability with respect to others, but also on factors from kinetics, to advances in synthesis techniques, to the availability of precursors. This complexity makes the development of a general theory or first-principles approach to synthesizability currently impractical. Here we show how an alternative pathway to predicting synthesizability emerges from the dynamics of the materials stability network: a scale-free network constructed by combining the convex free-energy surface of inorganic materials computed by high-throughput density functional theory and their experimental discovery timelines extracted from citations. The time-evolution of the underlying network properties allows us to use machine-learning to predict the likelihood that hypothetical, computer-generated materials will be amenable to successful experimental synthesis.},

However, the new models have not been profiled on consistent tasks, and comparative studies to wellestablished algorithms have only seldom been performed. To standardize the assessment of both classical and neural models for de novo molecular design, we propose an evaluation framework, GuacaMol, based on a suite of standardized benchmarks. The benchmark tasks encompass measuring the fidelity of the models to reproduce the property distribution of the training sets, the ability to generate novel molecules, the exploration and exploitation of chemical space, and a variety of single and multiobjective optimization tasks.

The M3GNet IAP was trained on the massive database of structural relaxations performed by the Materials Project over the past ten years and has broad applications in structural relaxation, dynamic simulations and property prediction of materials across diverse chemical spaces. About 1.8 million materials from a screening of 31 million hypothetical crystal structures were identified to be potentially stable against existing Materials Project crystals based on M3GNet energies. Of the top 2,000 materials with the lowest energies above the convex hull, 1,578 were verified to be stable using density functional theory calculations.

  abstract = {Sequential learning for materials discovery is a paradigm where a computational agent solicits new data to simultaneously update a model in service of exploration (finding the largest number of materials that meet some criteria) or exploitation (finding materials with an ideal figure of merit). In real-world discovery campaigns, new data acquisition may be costly and an optimal strategy may involve using and acquiring data with different levels of fidelity, such as first-principles calculation to supplement an experiment. In this work, we introduce agents which can operate on multiple data fidelities, and benchmark their performance on an emulated discovery campaign to find materials with desired band gap values. The fidelities of data come from the results of DFT calculations as low fidelity and experimental results as high fidelity. We demonstrate performance gains of agents which incorporate multi-fidelity data in two contexts: either using a large body of low fidelity data as a prior knowledge base or acquiring low fidelity data in-tandem with experimental data. This advance provides a tool that enables materials scientists to test various acquisition and model hyperparameters to maximize the discovery rate of their own multi-fidelity sequential learning campaigns for materials discovery. This may also serve as a reference point for those who are interested in practical strategies that can be used when multiple data sources are available for active or sequential learning campaigns.},

Herein, we present a framework capable of general inverse design (not limited to a given set of elements or crystal structures), featuring a generalized invertible representation that encodes crystals in both real and reciprocal space, and a property-structured latent space from a variational autoencoder (VAE). In three design cases, the framework generates 142 new crystals with user-defined formation energies, bandgap, thermoelectric (TE) power factor, and combinations thereof. These generated crystals, absent in the training database, are validated by first-principles calculations. The success rates (number of first-principles-validated target-satisfying crystals/number of designed crystals) ranges between 7.1\% and 38.9\%. These results represent a significant step toward property-driven general inverse design using generative models, although practical challenges remain when coupled with experimental synthesis.},

This task is difficult because stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid, diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation metrics for the broader machine learning community.},

However, its effectiveness is severely limited by the lack of quantity and diversity of known materials deposited in the current materials repositories such as ICSD and OQMD. Recent progress in machine learning and especially deep learning have enabled a generative strategy that learns implicit chemical rules for creating chemically valid hypothetical materials with new compositions and structures. However, current materials generative models have difficulty in generating structurally diverse, chemically valid, and stable materials. Here we propose CubicGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep neural network model for large scale generation of novel cubic crystal structures. When trained on 375,749 ternary crystal materials from the OQMD database, we show that our model is able to not only rediscover most of the currently known cubic materials but also generate hypothetical materials of new structure prototypes. A total of 506 such new materials (all of them are either ternary or quarternary) have been verified by DFT based phonon dispersion stability check, several of which have been found to potentially have exceptional functional properties. Considering the importance of cubic materials in wide applications such as solar cells and lithium batteries, our GAN model provides a promising approach to significantly expand the current repository of materials, enabling the discovery of new functional materials via screening. The new crystal structures finally verified by DFT are freely accessible at our Carolina Materials Database http://www.carolinamatdb.org.},

  abstract = {Discovering new materials is a long-standing challenging task that is critical to the progress of human society. Conventional approaches such as trial-and-error experiments and computational simulations are labor-intensive or costly with their success heavily depending on experts' heuristics. Recently deep generative models have been successfully proposed for materials generation by learning implicit knowledge from known materials datasets, with performance however limited by their confinement to a special material family or failing to incorporate physical rules into the model training process. Here we propose a Physics Guided Crystal Generative Model (PGCGM) for new materials generation, which captures and exploits the pairwise atomic distance constraints among neighbor atoms and symmetric geometric constraints. By augmenting the base atom sites of materials, our model can generates new materials of 20 space groups. With atom clustering and merging on generated crystal structures, our method increases the generator's validity by 8 times compared to one of the baselines and by 143\% compared to the previous CubicGAN along with its superiority in properties distribution and diversity. We further validated our generated candidates by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation, which successfully optimized/relaxed 1869 materials out of 2000, of which 39.6\% are with negative formation energy, indicating their stability.},
