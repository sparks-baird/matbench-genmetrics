# Metrics

The four metrics used in `matbench-genmetrics` are validity, coverage, novelty, and uniqueness. We describe each in detail below.

## Validity

We define validity as one minus the Wasserstein distance between distribution of space group numbers for train and generated structures divided by the distance of the dummy case between train and the space group number 1:

$$
    1-\frac{w\left(\mathrm{SG}_{\mathrm{train}},\mathrm{SG}_{\mathrm{test}}\right)}{w\left(\mathrm{SG}_{\mathrm{train}},1\right)}
$$
where $w$, $\mathrm{SG}_{\mathrm{train}}$, and $\mathrm{SG}_{\mathrm{test}}$ represent Wasserstein distance, vector of space group numbers for the training data, and vector of space group numbers for the test data, respectively.

## Coverage

Coverage ("predict the future") is given by the match counts between the held-out test structures and the generated structures divided by the number of test structures:

$$
    \frac{\sum _{i=1}^{n_{\text{test}}} \sum _{j=1}^{n_{\text{gen}}} \left(
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}
            1 & d\left(s_{\text{test},i},s_{\text{gen},j}\right)\leq \text{tol} \\
            0 & d\left(s_{\text{test},i},s_{\text{gen},j}\right)>\text{tol} \\
        \end{array}
        \\
        \right.
        \right)}{n_{\text{test}}}
$$
where $n_{\text{test}}$, $n_{\text{gen}}$, $d$, $s_{\text{test},i}$, $s_{\text{gen},j}$, and $\text{tol}$ represent number of structures in the test set, number of structures in the generated set, crystallographic distance according to \texttt{StructureMatcher} from \texttt{pymatgen.analysis.structure\_matcher}, $i$-th structure of the test set, $j$-th structure of the generated set, and a tolerance threshold, respectively.

## Novelty

Novelty is given by one minus the match counts between train structures and generated structures divided by number of generated structures:

$$
    1-\frac{\sum _{i=1}^{n_{\text{train}}} \sum _{j=1}^{n_{\text{gen}}} \left(
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}
            1 & d\left(s_{\text{train},i},s_{\text{gen},j}\right)\leq \text{tol} \\
            0 & d\left(s_{\text{train},i},s_{\text{gen},j}\right)>\text{tol} \\
        \end{array}
        \\
        \right.
        \right)}{n_{\text{gen}}}
$$
where $n_{\text{train}}$, $n_{\text{gen}}$, $d$, $s_{\text{train},i}$, $s_{\text{gen},j}$, and $\text{tol}$ represent number of structures in the training set, number of structures in the generated set, crystallographic distance according to \texttt{StructureMatcher} from \texttt{pymatgen.analysis.structure\_matcher}, $i$-th structure of the training set, $j$-th structure of the generated set, and a tolerance threshold, respectively.

## Uniqueness

Uniqueness is given by one minus the non-self-comparing match counts within generated structures divided by total possible number of non-self-comparing matches:

$$
    1-\frac{\sum _{i=1}^{n_{\text{gen}}} \sum _{j=1}^{n_{\text{gen}}} \left(
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}
            0 & i=j \\
            1 & d\left(s_{\text{gen},i},s_{\text{gen},j}\right)\leq \text{tol}\land i\neq j \\
            0 & d\left(s_{\text{gen},i},s_{\text{gen},j}\right)>\text{tol}\land i\neq j \\
        \end{array}
        \\
        \right.
        \right)}{n_{\text{gen}}^2-n_{\text{gen}}}
$$
where $n_{\text{gen}}$, $d$, $s_{\text{gen},i}$, $s_{\text{gen},j}$, and $\text{tol}$
represent number of structures in the generated set, crystallographic distance according
to `StructureMatcher` from `pymatgen.analysis.structure_matcher`, $i$-th
structure of the generated set, $j$-th structure of the generated set, and a tolerance
threshold, respectively.

##

While useful individually, these metrics can also be used as multi-criteria filtering. One reason this is important is because, standalone, the metrics can be "hacked" in some sense. For example, the novelty metric may be made perfect simply by generating a diverse set of nonsensical crystal structures. Likewise, the validity score may be bloated simply by passing in the list of training structures as the generated structures. To combat this, multiple criteria may be considered simultaneously: for example, requiring that a structure must be simultaneously novel, unique, and passing certain filtering criteria such as non-overlapping atoms, stoichiometry rules, or [checkCIF](https://checkcif.iucr.org/) criteria (DOI: [10.1107/S2056989019016244](https://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2056989019016244)). Additional filters based on maching learning prediction models can be used for properties such as formation energy (i.e., must be negative), energy above hull, ICSD classification, and coordination number. Of particular interest is applying machine-learning based structural relaxation to the structures prior to filtering through universal interatomic potential models such as [M3GNet](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-022-00349-3).
